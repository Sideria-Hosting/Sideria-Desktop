<p></p>
<p>The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution</p>

<p></p>
<p>2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope</p>
<p></p>
<p>The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under</p>
<p>this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the</p>
<p>distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a</p>
<p>Contributor:</p>
<p></p>
<p>(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;</p>

<p>    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its</p>
<p>    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor</p>

<p></p>
<p>This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,</p>
<p>or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with</p>
<p>the notice requirements in Section 3.4).</p>
<p></p>
<p>2.4. Subsequent Licenses</p>
<p></p>
<p>No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to</p>
<p>distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this</p>
<p>License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if</p>
<p>permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).</p>
<p></p>
<p>2.5. Representation</p>
<p></p>
<p>Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its</p>
<p>Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights</p>
<p>to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2.6. Fair Use</p>
<p></p>
<p>This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under</p>
<p>applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other</p>
<p>equivalents.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2.7. Conditions</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted</p>
<p>in Section 2.1.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Responsibilities</p>
<p>-------------------</p>
<p></p>
<p>3.1. Distribution of Source Form</p>
<p></p>
<p>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any</p>
<p>Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under</p>
<p>the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source</p>
<p>Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this</p>
<p>License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not</p>
<p>attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code</p>
<p>Form.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</p>
<p></p>
<p>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</p>
<p></p>
<p>(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code</p>
<p>    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of</p>
<p>    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code</p>
<p>    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more</p>
<p>    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and</p>
<p></p>
<p>(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this</p>
<p>    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the</p>
<p>    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter</p>
<p>    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</p>
<p></p>
<p>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,</p>
<p>provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for</p>
<p>the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered</p>
<p>Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the</p>
<p>Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this</p>
<p>License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software</p>
<p>under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of</p>
<p>the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered</p>
<p>Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary</p>
<p>License(s).</p>
<p></p>
<p>3.4. Notices</p>
<p></p>
<p>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices</p>
<p>(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,</p>
<p>or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of</p>
<p>the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to</p>
<p>the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3.5. Application of Additional Terms</p>
<p></p>
<p>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,</p>
<p>indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered</p>
<p>Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on</p>
<p>behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any</p>
<p>such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by</p>
<p>You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any</p>
<p>liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,</p>
<p>indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional</p>
<p>disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any</p>
<p>jurisdiction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------</p>
<p></p>
<p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this</p>
<p>License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to</p>
<p>statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with</p>
<p>the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)</p>
<p>describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must</p>
<p>be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered</p>
<p>Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute</p>
<p>or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a</p>
<p>recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. Termination</p>
<p>--------------</p>
<p></p>
<p>5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically</p>
<p>if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become</p>
<p>compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular</p>
<p>Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such</p>
<p>Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an</p>
<p>ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the</p>
<p>non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have</p>
<p>come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular</p>
<p>Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor</p>
<p>notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the</p>
<p>first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License</p>
<p>from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after</p>
<p>Your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent</p>
<p>infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,</p>
<p>counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version</p>
<p>directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to</p>
<p>You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section</p>
<p>2.1 of this License shall terminate.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all</p>
<p>end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which</p>
<p>have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License</p>
<p>prior to termination shall survive termination.</p>
<p></p>

<p>*  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *</p>
<p>*  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *</p>
<p>*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *</p>
<p>*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *</p>
<p>*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *</p>
<p>*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *</p>
<p>*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *</p>
<p>*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *</p>
<p>*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *</p>
<p>*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *</p>
<p>*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *</p>
<p>*                                                                      *</p>

<p>*  7. Limitation of Liability                                          *</p>
<p>*  --------------------------                                          *</p>
<p>*                                                                      *</p>
<p>*  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *</p>
<p>*  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *</p>
<p>*  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *</p>
<p>*  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,         *</p>
<p>*  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      *</p>
<p>*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *</p>

<p>*  and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party      *</p>
<p>*  shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This   *</p>
<p>*  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or   *</p>
<p>*  personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the       *</p>

<p>*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *</p>
<p>*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *</p>
<p>*  limitation may not apply to You.                                    *</p>
<p>*                                                                      *</p>

<p>-------------</p>
<p></p>
<p>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the</p>
<p>courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal</p>
<p>place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that</p>
<p>jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.</p>
<p>Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring</p>
<p>cross-claims or counter-claims.</p>
<p></p>

<p>----------------</p>
<p></p>
<p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject</p>
